# HALITE Kaggle Competition

## Overview

This repository contains our team's solutions for the HALITE competition hosted on Kaggle. HALITE is an artificial intelligence programming challenge where participants write algorithms to control a fleet of ships in a resource management game. The objective is to collect and deposit as much halite (a fictional resource) as possible. Competitors' bots navigate a game board, manage ship fleets, optimize resource collection, and strategically interact with opponent ships.

## Game Mechanics

- **Resource Collection:** Ships harvest halite from the map by staying on a cell.
- **Ship Management:** Players must decide when to build new ships and when to convert ships into shipyards.
- **Combat and Defense:** Ships can attack opponents' ships to disrupt their operations.
- **Efficiency and Strategy:** Optimal paths must be chosen to maximize halite collection and minimize travel time.

## Installation
